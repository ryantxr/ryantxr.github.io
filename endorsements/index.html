<p>I contracted Ryan through his company Blazecore in 2017 and for the next three years he was my go to technical
advisor and trusted architect. Upon engagement, he immediately did an evaluation and put processes in place
to ensure better stability and long term viability for the platform. He took over the deployment duties for
the production platform. He listened carefully and gave his throughts and feedback, giving sound advice based on
practical considerations.</p>

<p>I reported to Ryan at First Data. He was the kind of manager any developer would love to work with.
He gives a plenty of room to developers and always guides them with his technical acumen.
He is very considerate and helpful. He is open for suggestions, does not hesitate to try various
approaches and his knowledge is not limited to any particular technology.
Above all, he is a great person and I wish I get a chance to work with him again.</p>

<p>Ryan is one of the best Software Architects I've had the pleasure of working with at First Data.
Beyond his abilities to develop, Ryan consistently exhibited confidence and zeal.
He was always looking for ways to improve the system design and took time to thoroughly
understand the intended end-result.
Ryan is a true collaborator, top-notch architect,
and expert in his craft. I would definitely recommend Ryan as he is an
asset to any company that is lucky enough to have him on their team.</p>
