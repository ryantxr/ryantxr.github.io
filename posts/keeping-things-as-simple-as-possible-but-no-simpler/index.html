  <h2 id="simplicity-is-hard-to-do">Simplicity is hard to do</h2>
<p>Software developers like to make things complicated. They take something that could be simple and easy make it complicated.
Several people use the word simplicity. I'm not so sure they know what that means. Simple for who?
Einstein famously said that any system has to be as simple as possible but no simpler.</p>
<p>One thing is certain. Simple systems do not have a lot of features. A paper clip is simple. If you are the one designing the product,
how do you keep complexity in check? Perhaps simple only means how it is presented to the end user. It might be complicated under the hood.</p>
<p>I think people also confuse simple with easy to learn or easy to use. These all represent different ideas.</p>
<p>Which is it? A simple engineering? A simple interface?</p>
<p>Something might be easy to use, provided someone showed you how to use it. A thing can be easy to use but not easy to learn.
I will make the statement that easy to learn is less important that easy to use. If you are going to be using some product
repeatedly, then you would want it to be easy to use. But if someone first has to show you how to use it, that isn't such a big deal.</p>
<p>I once built a program to send SMS. And during the course of building the process to send the messages, I realized that
it had to be super reliable. It could never send the same message to the same person twice. And it had to be able to scale so that
it could use more processors if necessary. What came out of that was a complex piece of software. It had to be.
However, the end users could just send it a list of numbers and when to send them and it would do it.
It was easy to use, but under the hood it was quite complex.</p>
