  <h1 id="why-you-should-try-to-deliver-software-in-small-increments">Why you should try to deliver software in small increments</h1>
<p>Traditionally, software was done in big chunks. A team would put together a
huge documents describing what they wanted. Then another team would go off and build it.
Eventually, months later, they would deliver it. Often, it would not do what they really wanted.
Why is that?</p>
<p>When someone writes down what they want the software to do, they cannot write everything.
It is imposible. And if this is what the team building it has to go on, then at best they can build what was written.
What often happened is that they build team did what they understood from the writing.</p>
<p>A better approach is to lay out a grand design but do the implementation in smaller steps.
At each stage, deliver working software. The way this might work is like this.
A team expresses a desire to develop and application. The build team takes a small step and delivers something.
Let's say this took two weeks. At the end of this time they deliver something. It may not be shippable a that time.
Nevertheless, it is completed. The team then sets about building the next step.
This might be a user interface. But they only build one small part of the user interface which they deliver in another two weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, if you know this stuff, this is the agile methodology.</p>
<p>Why does it work?</p>
<p>Remember that first project that didn't exactly work the way that the product team wanted? How might they have avoided that?
Well, they could have let the team do a small piece. Then after the first two weeks, talk with the engineers to explain what they want.
Communicating is better than documentation. And here is a key element. The teams, product and engineering only have to talk
about the piece that they are currently implementing. They have to hold less in their head.
They don't have to think about 157 tasks and which comes first or last.</p>
<p>Let's say our product has its first public release. It is really minimal but it does something useful.
The product team gather some feedback and decides on what they want to do next. At each stage of the product development
they learn from the previous development phases. And with this knowledge they make better decisions.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of this?</p>
<p>You can develop new features based on what you can afford when you have the money. And you can always have a working product
at all times. If at any point the project goes off track, you don't lose much. Even if it is the worst disaster, you won't lose much.</p>
<p>You learn as you go. As you introduce new features to the public, you will get feedback.
But even if it isn't a product for the public you will still learn even if you are the only one using the software.</p>
<p>Building software in small increments has the benefit of increasing the flexibilty of the software engineering process.
The product then becomes a collaboration between all the teams. The business can then change direction as needed.
And this results in software that better matches what the business needs.</p>
