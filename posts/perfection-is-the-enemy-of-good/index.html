<p>It is better to talk about excellence rather than perfect. Has anything ever been perfect?
Every product is missing something. How many version of the iPhone are there?
You mean the first one wasn't perfect? It was excellent but it lacked many features that were easy to identify.
This is true about many of the software products we use today. I'm not going to list products. Make a list of every product you use.
Think about how many versions of that product exist.</p>
<p>Aiming at perfection is a neverending quest. There is no such thing as perfection.</p>
<p>This applies to software in the following way. When building a software product, we can always think of what else to put into it.
It should do this or that. These features take time. And they are often not necessary. If your software is for external users,
how do you really know if that feature will work for your users or not. You can make reasonable guesses. That is all they are.
You won't know if they will really work until the users actually try it out.
Some people get lucky. But often, features miss the mark. That's ok. Software sometimes is like that.</p>
<p>I think of software like installing carpet. Waste is a part of the process. It can be expensive and we don't want to waste time and effort.
Sometimes this happens. And the waste might be to throw away some code that took quite some time to write.</p>
